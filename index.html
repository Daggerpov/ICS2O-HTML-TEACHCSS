    <h1>CSS For Beginners</h1>

    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    
    <p id="paragraph1">Well, CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</p>
    
    <p>It's used in tandam with HTML in order to describe various HTML elements.
        This means that it can adjust previously coded HTML.
    </p>

    <p style="color:blue; font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;">It's useful to describe these elements in general, rather than individually 
        having to describe them in the HTML tag as shown below:
        <br><br><img src="./images/styling in HTML.jpg">
    </p>

    <p>CSS saves you time and energy, by essentially being like a function in the 
        sense that, instead of having to repeat a process multiple times, you 
        can simply call that function. In this case, this would describe how
        describing an HTML element in CSS can be applied to all instances of 
        that element, rather than having to describe it in the HTML script 
        for every single instance.
    </p>

    <h2>How CSS Works</h2>

    <h3>Selector</h3>

    <p>The selector is a pointer to the HTML element you want to adjust with your rule-set. It's 
        made up of one or more elements. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Declaration Blocks</h3>

    <p>The declarations are made up of the rules you want to use in order to adjust said elements. 
        They are made up of properties and values, separated by a colon and ended off with a semicolon. 
        You can find various properties by following <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/">this link</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>


    <h2>Internal CSS vs. External CSS</h2>
    
    <h3>Internal CSS</h3>
    
    <p>An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the 'head' section 
        of the HTML file as shown below:
        <br><br><img src="./images/internal css in HTML head tag.jpg">
    </p>
    
    <p>This can only be used to define a style for one singular HTML page, rather 
        than being able to do it for multiple like External CSS can.
    </p>

    <p>Like External CSS, though, the rules defined in the 'style' tag will apply to all tagged 
        elements on the page.
    </p>

    <h4>Example:</h4>

    <br><br><img src="./images/internal css example.jpg">

    <h3>External CSS</h3>

    <p>An external stylesheet is a file created to link to a web page. Its file extension is ".css" and is 
        normally linked to an HTML or JS file. Below, I'll show you how to link it to an HTML file:
        <br><br><img src="./images/linking css to html file.jpg">
    </p>
    
    <p>The advantage of having external stylesheets is that it can be created once and the rules may be 
        applied to multiple web pages. Should you need to make widespread changes to your site design, you 
        can make a single change in the stylesheet and it'll be applied to all linked pages, saving time and effort.
    </p>

    <h4>Example:</h4>

    <br><br><img src="./images/external css example.jpg">

    <h2>Other Selectors</h2>
    
    <p>These can both be selected in CSS code, just like an HTML element in a selector as shown below:
        <br><br><img src="./images/css id.jpg">
    </p>
    
    <h3>ID Selector</h3>

    <p>The ID selector uses the ID attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element, as opposed to 
        all elements with the same tag like 'p'. The ID of an element is unique within a page. In order to 
        select an element by its unique ID, type the hash character, followed by the element's ID.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="selector">Class Selector</h3>

    <p>Similarly to the ID selector, it selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. However, 
        this isn't unique to a specific element, since multiple elements can be objects with the same 
        class attributes. 
    </p>
    
    <p>To select elements that are objects of this specific class, type a period character, followed by 
        the class name, as shown below: 
        <br><br><img src="./images/css class.jpg">
    </p>

    <p class="big blue">Additionally, HTML elements can refer to more than one class, as shown below: 
        <br><br><img src="./images/multi class p.jpg">
    </p>
